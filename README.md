# EnderSX2
These are official apks for EnderSX2 to expand on the amazing work already done by Anon, EZOnTheEyes and Tahlreth / Stenzek.

They aim to do the following:

- Remove the unnecessary ad services bloat left in the apk
- Fix the RetroAchievements Notifications
Expose more Global settings in the App Settings to the user
- Update the GameDB, Controller Support, and the Widescreen and No-Interlace Patches
- Add additional AetherSX2/EnderSX2 specific fixes to the GameDB

# Requirements
There are no requirements for EnderSX2. But, if you want to transfer your original Aether/NetherSX2 save data you will need a copy of the [Shizuku 13.5.4 apk.](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku/releases/download/v13.5.4/shizuku-v13.5.4.r1049.0e53409-release.apk)
I dont provide a Shizuku activation tutorial, please search on youtube or in the official [Shizuku website.](https://shizuku.rikka.app/guide/setup/#start-via-wireless-debugging)
